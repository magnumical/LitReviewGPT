# LitReviewGPT
A systematic way to extract info from papers

I assume you already have access to text, txt file, .doc, or .pdf file of the paper you are interested in. 


first essage to chatGPT will be:
```
Read this article completely and answer to my questions in the next message:
[paper material from METHODS to end]
```

Then, these questions can be asked (adjust based on purpuse of your paper)in the following format:

``` Read article carefully and pay attention to every detail. Tell me what authors wrote about:
[INFORMATION YOU ARE INQUIRING TO BE COPIED HERE]
I prefer exact sentence and quotation fro paper but you can also write me your understanding and summarization. I don't want you to write it yourself. answer in bullet points. Set your laziness to zero and read all texts. Be detailed in your answers. When mentioning study description, be detailed. when mentioned equipment or devices or techniques, write exact names and list (model name). You can be concise while answering. You don't need to form a sentence. it can be short and brief in terms of length, but include everything and comprehensive
